    "## Getting started with `c`\n",
    "\n",
    "Intro to `c` syntax and program flow should be already covered in lecture and there are *a lot* of resources online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `c` is a *[statically typed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages)* language\n",
    "- `c` is a *[compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language)* language\n",
    "- [Here](https://cheatography.com/ashlyn-black/cheat-sheets/c-reference/) is a great cheat sheet for `c` & is very \"`CTRL-F`-able\", so to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some frequently asked questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the `main` function?  \n",
    "A: `main` is the entry point to your program. It is the first function that gets called when your program starts and every `c` executable must have a `main` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I run my `c` program?  \n",
    "A: This will depend on your operating system and environment. I recommend using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) alongside [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) for debugging. \n",
    "As for text editors, I recommend using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and following [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) to get started.\n",
    "Personally I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) and a terminal-centric development workflow, however, the learning curve is rather steep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do `#include`s work? Does order matter?  \n",
    "A: `#include`s are used to import libraries and other files into your program. \n",
    "Ideally, order *should* not matter and header files should be self-contained (for convention-abiding code), but it *can* matter in edge cases where one tries to squeeze some extra performance out of a program, or if one is working with a finicky library. \n",
    "To make sure you don't encounter errors while working with multi-file projects, **always** use [`#include` guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard)!\n",
    "See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/691079/is-there-a-standard-include-convention-for-c) for general best practices."
