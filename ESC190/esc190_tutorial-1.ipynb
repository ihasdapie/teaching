    "### Getting started with `c`\n",
    "\n",
    "Intro to `c` syntax and program flow should be already covered in lecture and there are *a lot* of resources online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `c` is a *[statically typed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages)* language\n",
    "- `c` is a *[compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language)* language\n",
    "- [Here](https://cheatography.com/ashlyn-black/cheat-sheets/c-reference/) is a great cheat sheet for `c` & is very \"`CTRL-F`-able\", so to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some frequently asked questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the `main` function?  \n",
    "A: `main` is the entry point to your program. It is the first function that gets called when your program starts and every `c` executable must have a `main` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I run my `c` program?  \n",
    "A: This will depend on your operating system and environment. I recommend using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) alongside [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) for debugging. \n",
    "As for text editors, I recommend using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and following [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) to get started.\n",
    "Personally I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) and a terminal-centric development workflow, however, the learning curve is rather steep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do `#include`s work? Does order matter?  \n",
    "A: `#include`s are used to import libraries and other files into your program. \n",
    "Ideally, order *should* not matter and header files should be self-contained (for convention-abiding code), but it *can* matter in edge cases where one tries to squeeze some extra performance out of a program, or if one is working with a finicky library. \n",
    "To make sure you don't encounter errors while working with multi-file projects, **always** use [`#include` guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard)!\n",
    "See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/691079/is-there-a-standard-include-convention-for-c) for general best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity analysis & sorting algorithms\n",
    "See [my writeup from ESC180](https://github.com/ihasdapie/teaching/blob/main/ESC180/ESC180_Unofficial_Review.ipynb) regarding complexity analysis.\n",
    "The following will walk through finding the time and space complexity of various sorting algorithms as well as some general comments.\n",
    "[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_of_algorithms) is a good table of common sorting algorithms and their best/worst/average case time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity analysis of some common sorting algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an unsorted array of integers, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bubble sort\n",
    "Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void bubble_sort(int[] arr, int n) {\n",
    "    int i, j, tmp;\n",
    "    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "        for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {\n",
    "            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n",
    "                tmp = arr[j];\n",
    "                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n",
    "                arr[j + 1] = tmp;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify \"elementary operation\"\n",
    "    - Swapping two adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order\n",
    "2.  Pick `n`\n",
    "    -   Take `n` to be the size of the input array.\n",
    "3. Inspect how much the \"elementary operation\" is performed relative to `n` \n",
    "    - The elementary operation is performed `n` times in a loop that runs `n` times, so the time complexity is `O(n^2)`\n",
    "4. Inspect how much additional space is used relative to `n`\n",
    "    - We perform the swaps in-place and only allocate three additional variables, `i`, `j`, and `tmp`, so the space complexity is `O(1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insertion sort\n",
    "Inserting sort works by maintaining a sorted sublist and inserting each element into the correct position in the sublist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void insertion_sort(int[] arr, int n) {\n",
    "    int i, j;\n",
    "    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "        j = i - 1;\n",
    "        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > arr[i]) {\n",
    "            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];\n",
    "            j = j - 1;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        arr[j + 1] = arr[i];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify \"elementary operation\"\n",
    "    - Inserting an element into the correct position in the sorted sublist\n",
    "2.  Pick `n`\n",
    "    -   Take `n` to be the size of the input array.\n",
    "3. Inspect how much the \"elementary operation\" is performed relative to `n` \n",
    "    - The elementary operation is performed in a `while` loop that runs (in the worst case), `n` times, which is in turn in a `for` loop that runs `n` times, so the time complexity is `O(n^2)`\n",
    "4. Inspect how much additional space is used relative to `n`\n",
    "    - We perform the insertions in-place and only allocate two additional variables, `i` and `j`, so the space complexity is `O(1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-up questions:\n",
    "- If insertion sort and bubble sort have the same time and space complexity, why is insertion sort faster?\n",
    "  - Hint: consider non-worst case scenarios. How many times would the inner `while` loop iterate during an average case? Or the best case?\n",
    "- Is the sort [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability)? Why?\n",
    "- What if we weren't allowed to modify the input array? What would the space complexities be?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selection sort\n",
    "Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element in the unsorted array and swapping it with the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void selection_sort(int[] arr, int n) {\n",
    "    int i, j, min_idx, tmp;\n",
    "    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n",
    "        min_idx = i;\n",
    "        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {\n",
    "            if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {\n",
    "                min_idx = j;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        tmp = arr[i];\n",
    "        arr[i] = arr[min_idx];\n",
    "        arr[min_idx] = tmp;\n",
